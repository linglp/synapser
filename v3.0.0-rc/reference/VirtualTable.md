# VirtualTable

A virtual table is a type of table that is dynamically built from a
Synapse SQL query. Its content is read only and based off the
`defining_sql` attribute. The SQL of the virtual table may NOT contain
JOIN or UNION clauses and must reference a table that has a non-empty
schema.

A `VirtualTable` object represents this `VirtualTable` API model in
Synapse:
\<https://rest-docs.synapse.org/rest/org/sagebionetworks/repo/model/table/VirtualTable.html\>

## Usage

``` r
VirtualTable(id=NULL, name=NULL, parent_id=NULL, activity=NULL, version_number=NULL, description=NULL, etag=NULL, created_on=NULL, modified_on=NULL, created_by=NULL, modified_by=NULL, version_label=NULL, version_comment=NULL, is_latest_version=NULL, columns=list(), is_search_enabled=NULL, defining_sql=NULL, annotations=list())
```

## Format

An S3-style class object.

## Arguments

- id:

  (Optional\[str\]) The unique immutable ID for this entity. Once
  issued, this ID is guaranteed to never change or be re-issued.

- name:

  (Optional\[str\]) The name of this entity. Must be 256 characters or
  less. Names may only contain: letters, numbers, spaces, underscores,
  hyphens, periods, plus signs, apostrophes, and parentheses.

- parent_id:

  (Optional\[str\]) The ID of the Entity that is the parent of this
  entity.

- activity:

  (Optional\[Activity\]) The Activity model represents the main record
  of Provenance in Synapse.

- version_number:

  (Optional\[int\]) The version number issued to this version on the
  object.

- description:

  (Optional\[str\]) The description of this entity. Must be 1000
  characters or less.

- etag:

  (Optional\[str\]) Synapse employs an Optimistic Concurrency Control
  (OCC) scheme to handle concurrent updates. Since the E-Tag changes
  every time an entity is updated it is used to detect when a client's
  current representation of an entity is out-of-date.

- created_on:

  (Optional\[str\]) The date this entity was created.

- modified_on:

  (Optional\[str\]) The date this entity was last modified. In
  YYYY-MM-DD-Thh:mm:ss.sssZ format.

- created_by:

  (Optional\[str\]) The ID of the user that created this entity.

- modified_by:

  (Optional\[str\]) The ID of the user that last modified this entity.

- version_label:

  (Optional\[str\]) The version label for this entity.

- version_comment:

  (Optional\[str\]) The version comment for this entity.

- is_latest_version:

  (Optional\[bool\]) If this is the latest version of the object.

- columns:

  (Optional\[OrderedDict\[str, Column\]\]) (Read Only) The columns of a
  virtual table are dynamic based on the select statement of the
  definingSQL. This list of columnIds is for read-only purposes.

- is_search_enabled:

  (Optional\[bool\]) When creating or updating a table or view specifies
  if full text search should be enabled.

- defining_sql:

  (Optional\[str\]) The synapse SQL statement that defines the data in
  the virtual table. This field may NOT contain JOIN or UNION clauses.
  If a JOIN or UNION clause is present, a `ValueError` will be raised
  when the `store` method is called.

- annotations:

  (Optional\[dict\[str, Union\[list\[str\], list\[bool\], list\[float\],
  list\[int\], list\[date\], list\[datetime\]\]\]\]) Additional metadata
  associated with the virtual table. The key is the name of your desired
  annotations. The value is an object containing a list of values (use
  empty list to represent no values for key) and the value type
  associated with all values in the list. To remove all annotations set
  this to an empty named list
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html) or NULL and store the
  entity.

## Value

NULL

## Methods

- `VirtualTable(id=NULL, name=NULL, parent_id=NULL, activity=NULL, version_number=NULL, description=NULL, etag=NULL, created_on=NULL, modified_on=NULL, created_by=NULL, modified_by=NULL, version_label=NULL, version_comment=NULL, is_latest_version=NULL, columns=list(), is_search_enabled=NULL, defining_sql=NULL, annotations=list())`:
  Constructor for `VirtualTable`

- [`synDeletePermissions`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/reference/VirtualTable_DeletePermissions.md)`(instance, include_self=TRUE, include_container_content=FALSE, recursive=FALSE, target_entity_types=NULL, dry_run=FALSE, show_acl_details=TRUE, show_files_in_containers=TRUE, synapse_client=NULL)`:
  Delete the entire **local** Access Control List (ACL) for a given
  Entity. This is not scoped to a specific user or group, but rather
  removes all permissions associated with the Entity. After this
  operation, the Entity will inherit permissions from its benefactor,
  which is typically its parent entity or the Project it belongs to.  
    
  In order to remove permissions for a specific user or group, you
  should use the
  [`synSetPermissions()`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/reference/VirtualTable_SetPermissions.md)
  function with the `access_type` set to an empty list.  
    
  By default, Entities such as FileEntity and Folder inherit their
  permission from their containing Project. For such Entities the
  Project is the Entity's 'benefactor'. This permission inheritance can
  be overridden by creating an ACL for the Entity. When this occurs the
  Entity becomes its own benefactor and all permission are determined by
  its own ACL.  
    
  If the ACL of an Entity is deleted, then its benefactor will
  automatically be set to its parent's benefactor.  
    
  **Special notice for Projects:** The ACL for a Project cannot be
  deleted, you must individually update or revoke the permissions for
  each user or group.

- [`synGetAcl`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/reference/VirtualTable_GetAcl.md)`(instance, principal_id=NULL, check_benefactor=TRUE, synapse_client=NULL)`:
  Get the
  [ACL](https://rest-docs.synapse.org/rest/org/sagebionetworks/repo/model/ACCESS_TYPE.html)
  that a user or group has on an Entity.

- [`synGetPermissions`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/reference/VirtualTable_GetPermissions.md)`(instance, synapse_client=NULL)`:
  Get the
  [permissions](https://python-docs.synapse.org/reference/permissions/)
  that the caller has on an Entity.

- [`synListAcl`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/reference/VirtualTable_ListAcl.md)`(instance, recursive=FALSE, include_container_content=FALSE, target_entity_types=NULL, log_tree=FALSE, synapse_client=NULL)`:
  List the Access Control Lists (ACLs) for this entity and optionally
  its children.  
    
  This function returns the local sharing settings for the entity and
  optionally its children. It provides a mapping of all ACLs for the
  given container/entity.  
    
  **Important Note:** This function returns the LOCAL sharing settings
  only, not the effective permissions that each Synapse User ID/Team has
  on the entities. More permissive permissions could be granted via a
  Team that the user has access to that has permissions on the entity,
  or through inheritance from parent entities.

- [`synQuery`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/reference/VirtualTable_Query.md)`(query, include_row_id_and_row_version=TRUE, convert_to_datetime=FALSE, download_location=NULL, quote_character="\"", escape_character=r"(\)", line_end="\n", separator=",", header=TRUE, timeout=250L, synapse_client=NULL)`:
  Query for data on a table stored in Synapse. The results will always
  be returned as a data frame unless you specify a `download_location`
  in which case the results will be downloaded to that location. There
  are a number of arguments that you may pass to this function depending
  on if you are getting the results back as a DataFrame or downloading
  the results to a file.

- [`synQueryPartMask`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/reference/VirtualTable_QueryPartMask.md)`(query, part_mask, timeout=250L, synapse_client=NULL)`:
  Query for data on a table stored in Synapse. This is a more advanced
  use case of the
  [`synQuery()`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/reference/VirtualTable_Query.md)
  function that allows you to determine what additional metadata about
  the table or query should also be returned. If you do not need this
  additional information then you are better off using the
  [`synQuery()`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/reference/VirtualTable_Query.md)
  function.  
    
  The query for this method uses this Rest API:  
  \<https://rest-docs.synapse.org/rest/POST/entity/id/table/query/async/start.html\>

- [`synSetPermissions`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/reference/VirtualTable_SetPermissions.md)`(instance, principal_id=NULL, access_type=NULL, modify_benefactor=FALSE, warn_if_inherits=TRUE, overwrite=TRUE, synapse_client=NULL)`:
  Sets permission that a user or group has on an Entity. An Entity may
  have its own ACL or inherit its ACL from a benefactor.

## Example 1: Create a new virtual table with a defining SQL query.
    library(synapser)
    synLogin()

    virtual_table = VirtualTable(
        name = "My Virtual Table",
        description = "A test virtual table",
        parent_id = "syn12345",
        defining_sql = "SELECT * FROM syn67890"
    ) |> synStore()
    cat("Created Virtual Table with ID:", virtual_table$id, "\n")

## Example 2: Update the defining SQL of an existing virtual table.
    library(synapser)
    synLogin()

    virtual_table = VirtualTable(id = "syn12345") |> synGet()
    virtual_table$defining_sql = "SELECT column1, column2 FROM syn67890"
    virtual_table = virtual_table |> synStore()
    cat("Updated Virtual Table defining SQL.\n")

## Example 3: Delete a virtual table.
    library(synapser)
    synLogin()

    virtual_table = VirtualTable(id = "syn12345")
