# Annotations

## Overview

Annotations help users search for and find data, and they are a powerful
tool used to systematically group and/or describe things in Synapse.

Annotations are stored as key-value pairs in Synapse, where the key
defines a particular aspect of your data, for example (`species`,
`assay`, `fileFormat`) and the value defines a variable that belongs to
that category (`mouse`, `RNAseq`, `.bam`). You can use annotations to
add additional information about a project, file, folder, table, or
view.

Annotations can be based on an existing ontology or controlled
vocabulary, or can be created as needed and modified later as your
metadata evolves.

**Note:** You may optionally follow the [Uploading data in
bulk](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/articles/upload_data_in_bulk.md)
tutorial instead. The bulk tutorial may fit your needs better as it
limits the amount of code that you are required to write and maintain.

In this tutorial you will:

1.  Add several annotations to stored files
2.  Upload 2 new files and set the annotations at the same time

## Prerequisites

- Make sure that you have completed the
  [Files](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/articles/file.md)
  vignette or have at least 1 file in your Synapse project.

## 1. Add several annotations to stored files

### First let’s retrieve all of the Synapse IDs we are going to use

``` r

library(synapser)
synLogin()

# Retrieve the project ID
my_project_id <- (
  Project(name = "My uniquely named project about Alzheimer's Disease") |> synGet()
)$id

# Retrieve the folders I want to annotate files in
batch_1_folder <- Folder(
  name = "single_cell_RNAseq_batch_1",
  parent_id = my_project_id
) |> synGet()

cat("Batch 1 Folder ID:", batch_1_folder$id, "\n")
```

### Next let’s define the annotations I want to set

``` r

# Define the annotations I want to set
annotation_values <- list(
  species = "Homo sapiens",
  dataType = "geneExpression",
  assay = "SCRNA-seq",
  fileFormat = "fastq"
)
```

### Finally we’ll loop over all of the files and set their annotations

`synSyncFromSynapse()` with `download_file = FALSE` fills in the
folder’s `files` field without downloading any file content.

``` r

batch_1_folder <- batch_1_folder |> synSyncFromSynapse(download_file = FALSE)

# Loop over all of the files and set their annotations
for (file_batch_1 in batch_1_folder$files) {
  # Grab and print the existing annotations this File may already have
  existing_annotations_for_file <- file_batch_1$annotations

  cat(
    "Got the annotations for File:", paste0(file_batch_1$name, ","),
    "ID:", paste0(file_batch_1$id, ","),
    "Annotations:", rjson::toJSON(existing_annotations_for_file), "\n"
  )

  # Merge the new annotations with anything existing
  existing_annotations_for_file <- modifyList(
    existing_annotations_for_file, annotation_values
  )

  file_batch_1 <- file_batch_1 |>
    synSetProperties(annotations = existing_annotations_for_file) |>
    synStore()
  cat(
    "Set the annotations for File:", paste0(file_batch_1$name, ","),
    "ID:", paste0(file_batch_1$id, ","),
    "Annotations:", rjson::toJSON(existing_annotations_for_file), "\n"
  )
}
```

You’ll see that each file now has a number of annotations:

    Batch 1 Folder ID: syn53205629
    Got the annotations for File: SRR12345678_R1.fastq.gz, ID: syn53205687, Annotations: {}
    Set the annotations for File: SRR12345678_R1.fastq.gz, ID: syn53205687, Annotations: {'assay': ['SCRNA-seq'], 'species': ['Homo sapiens'], 'dataType': ['geneExpression'], 'fileFormat': ['fastq']}
    Got the annotations for File: SRR12345678_R2.fastq.gz, ID: syn53205688, Annotations: {}
    Set the annotations for File: SRR12345678_R2.fastq.gz, ID: syn53205688, Annotations: {'assay': ['SCRNA-seq'], 'species': ['Homo sapiens'], 'dataType': ['geneExpression'], 'fileFormat': ['fastq']}

## 2. Upload 2 new files and set the annotations at the same time

Assuming we have a few new files we want to upload we’ll follow a
similar pattern defined in the
[Files](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0-rc/articles/file.md) vignette,
except now we’ll specify the `annotations` attribute before uploading
the file to Synapse.

In order for the following script to work please replace the files with
ones that already exist on your local machine.

``` r

batch_1_scrnaseq_new_file_1 <- File(
  path = path.expand("~/my_ad_project/single_cell_RNAseq_batch_1/SRR92345678_R1.fastq.gz"),
  parent_id = batch_1_folder$id,
  annotations = annotation_values
) |> synStore()

batch_1_scrnaseq_new_file_2 <- File(
  path = path.expand("~/my_ad_project/single_cell_RNAseq_batch_1/SRR92345678_R2.fastq.gz"),
  parent_id = batch_1_folder$id,
  annotations = annotation_values
) |> synStore()

cat(
  "Stored file:", paste0(batch_1_scrnaseq_new_file_1$name, ","),
  "ID:", paste0(batch_1_scrnaseq_new_file_1$id, ","),
  "Annotations:", rjson::toJSON(batch_1_scrnaseq_new_file_1$annotations, indent = 2), "\n"
)
cat(
  "Stored file:", paste0(batch_1_scrnaseq_new_file_2$name, ","),
  "ID:", paste0(batch_1_scrnaseq_new_file_2$id, ","),
  "Annotations:", rjson::toJSON(batch_1_scrnaseq_new_file_2$annotations, indent = 2), "\n"
)
```

You’ll notice the output looks like:

    Stored file: SRR92345678_R1.fastq.gz, ID: syn53206218, Annotations: {
      "assay": [
        "SCRNA-seq"
      ],
      "dataType": [
        "geneExpression"
      ],
      "fileFormat": [
        "fastq"
      ],
      "species": [
        "Homo sapiens"
      ]
    }
    Stored file: SRR92345678_R2.fastq.gz, ID: syn53206219, Annotations: {
      "assay": [
        "SCRNA-seq"
      ],
      "dataType": [
        "geneExpression"
      ],
      "fileFormat": [
        "fastq"
      ],
      "species": [
        "Homo sapiens"
      ]
    }

## Results

Now that you have annotated your files you’ll be able to inspect this on
the individual files in the Synapse web UI. It should look similar to:
