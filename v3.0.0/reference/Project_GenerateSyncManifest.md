# Project : generate_sync_manifest

Walk a local directory, mirror its folder hierarchy under this container
in Synapse, and write a CSV manifest ready for
[`synSyncToSynapse()`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/v3.0.0/reference/Project_SyncToSynapse.md).

The manifest has two columns: path (absolute, symlink-resolved) and
parentId (the Synapse ID of the file's containing folder). Existing
Synapse folders with matching names and parents are reused. Directory
symlinks inside directory_path are not followed; file symlinks record
the symlink path and upload the target's contents. Zero-byte files are
skipped with a warning — Synapse rejects empty files. I/O errors during
walk are logged and skipped; an empty source directory produces a
warning and a header-only manifest.

## Usage

``` r
synGenerateSyncManifest(instance, directory_path, manifest_path, synapse_client=NULL)
```

## Arguments

- instance:

  (Project) The Project instance to operate on.

- directory_path:

  (character) Path to the local directory to be pushed to Synapse.

- manifest_path:

  (character) Path where the generated manifest CSV will be written.

- synapse_client:

  (Optional\[Synapse\]) If not passed in, the last created instance from
  the Synapse class constructor will be used.

## Value

NULL

## Errors

\- An error is raised if this container's id is NULL, or if
directory_path does not exist or is not a directory, or if this
container's id exists in Synapse but is not a Folder or Project.  
- An error is also raised if this container's id does not exist in
Synapse.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
## Generate a manifest and upload the files
    # Mirror ./my_data under a Synapse project and then upload it.
    library(synapser)
    synLogin()

    project = Project(id = "syn12345")
    project |> synGenerateSyncManifest(
        directory_path = "./my_data",
        manifest_path = "manifest.csv"
    )
    project |> synSyncToSynapse(manifest_path = "manifest.csv")
} # }
```
