# Table : store_rows

Add or update rows in Synapse from the sources defined below. In most
cases the result of this function call will append rows to the table. In
the case of an update this method works on a full row replacement. What
this means is that you may not do a partial update of a row. If you want
to update a row you must pass in all the data for that row, or the data
for the columns not provided will be set to null.

If you'd like to update a row see the example `Updating rows in a table`
below.

If you'd like to perform an `upsert` or partial update of a row you may
use the
[`synUpsertRows()`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/latest/reference/Table_UpsertRows.md)
function. See that function for more information.

Note the following behavior for the order of columns:

\- If a column is added via the
[`synAddColumn()`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/latest/reference/Table_AddColumn.md)
function it will be added at the index you specify, or at the end of the
columns list.  
- If column(s) are added during the construction of your `Table`
instance, ie. `Table(columns = list(Column(name = "foo")))`, they will
be added at the beginning of the columns list.  
- If you use the `synStoreRows()` function and the
`schema_storage_strategy` is set to `INFER_FROM_DATA` the columns will
be added at the end of the columns list.

**How datetime values are interpreted:**

Synapse `DATE` columns store an exact moment in time, represented as the
number of milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00` UTC. Before upload,
datetime values are converted to that representation as follows:

\- Timezone-aware datetimes (`POSIXct` values created with a `tz`, e.g.
`as.POSIXct("2017-02-14 11:23", tz = "America/Los_Angeles")`) are
converted to UTC exactly. This is the recommended way to pass datetime
data: the stored value does not depend on the timezone settings of the
machine performing the upload or on the date the upload is run.  
- Naive datetimes (`POSIXct` values without a `tz`) are assumed to be in
the local timezone of the machine **at the time of upload**. That single
UTC offset is applied to every value, including values whose dates fall
in a different daylight saving period, which will be stored shifted by
one hour. For example, uploading `2017-02-14 11:23` (a PST date, UTC-8)
from a machine currently on PDT (UTC-7) stores `2017-02-14 18:23` UTC
instead of the correct `19:23` UTC. To avoid this, create your datetimes
with a timezone, e.g. `as.POSIXct(x, tz = "America/Los_Angeles")`.  
- Plain R `Date` values (as opposed to datetimes) are treated as
midnight of that date and converted the same way naive datetimes are:
using the local timezone of the machine **at the time of upload**, with
the same daylight-saving-shift risk described above.  
- Midnight values deserve extra care: the one-hour daylight saving shift
described above can move a naive midnight datetime — or a `Date`, which
is treated as midnight — to 11 PM of the previous day, changing the
calendar date the value displays as.

**Why timezone-aware values are recommended:**

A naive datetime such as `2017-02-14 11:23` is only "what a clock on the
wall said." Before it can be stored as an exact moment in time,
something has to answer: *a clock where?* Timezone-aware values answer
that question in the data itself; naive values leave the client to
guess, and it guesses the uploading machine's current timezone.

A zone name like `"America/Los_Angeles"` does not mean a fixed offset
such as UTC-8. It means "a Los Angeles wall clock" — and those clocks
move twice a year: UTC-7 in summer (PDT), UTC-8 in winter (PST). When
you create datetimes with `as.POSIXct(x, tz = "America/Los_Angeles")`, R
looks up what LA clocks were set to on each value's own date:

\- `2017-02-14` → winter → interpreted using UTC-8  
- `2018-10-01` → summer → interpreted using UTC-7

When the data is queried back with
[`synQuery`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/latest/reference/Table_Query.md)`(..., convert_to_datetime = TRUE)`,
`DATE` columns are returned as datetimes in UTC. See
[`vignette("tables", package = "synapser")`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/latest/articles/tables.md)
for how to work with the returned values and view them in another
timezone.

**Limitations:**

\- Synapse limits the number of rows that may be stored in a single
request to a CSV file that is 1GB. If you are storing a CSV file that is
larger than this limit the data will be chunked into smaller requests.
This process is done by reading the file once to determine what the row
and byte boundries are and calculating the MD5 hash of that portion,
then reading the file again to send the data to Synapse. This process is
done to ensure that the data is not corrupted during the upload process,
in addition Synapse requires the MD5 hash of the data to be sent in the
request along with the number of bytes that are being sent.  
- The limit of 1GB is also enforced when storing a named list or a data
frame. The data will be converted to a CSV format using the `to_csv()`
pandas function. If you are storing more than a 1GB file it is
recommended that you store the data as a CSV and use the file path to
upload the data. This is due to the fact that the data frame chunking
process is slower than reading portions of a file on disk and
calculating the MD5 hash of that portion.

The following is a Sequence Diagram that describes the process noted in
the limitation above. It shows how the data is chunked into smaller
requests when the data exceeds the limit of 1GB, and how portions of the
data are read from the CSV file on disk while being uploaded to Synapse.

## Usage

``` r
synStoreRows(instance, values, schema_storage_strategy=NULL, column_expansion_strategy=NULL, dry_run=FALSE, additional_changes=NULL, insert_size_bytes=943718400L, csv_table_descriptor=NULL, date_columns=NULL, date_format=NULL, read_csv_kwargs=NULL, to_csv_kwargs=NULL, job_timeout=600L, synapse_client=NULL)
```

## Arguments

- instance:

  (Table) The Table instance to operate on.

- values:

  (Union\[str, dict\[str, Any\], object\]) Supports storing data from
  the following sources:  
    
  - A string holding the path to a CSV file. If the
  `schema_storage_strategy` is set to `NULL` the data will be uploaded
  as is. If `schema_storage_strategy` is set to `INFER_FROM_DATA` the
  data will be read into a [Pandas
  DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#dataframe).
  The code makes assumptions about the format of the columns in the CSV
  as detailed in the
  [csv_to_pandas_df](https://python-docs.synapse.org/reference/experimental/sync/table/#csv-to-pandas-df-reference-sync)
  function. You may pass in additional arguments to the
  `csv_to_pandas_df` function by passing them in as keyword arguments to
  this function.  
  - A named list where the key is the column name and the value is one
  or more values. The values will be wrapped into a [Pandas
  DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#dataframe).
  You may pass in additional arguments to the pandas DataFrame
  constructor by passing them in as keyword arguments to this function.
  Read about the available arguments in the [Pandas
  DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)
  documentation.  
  - A [Pandas
  DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#dataframe)

- schema_storage_strategy:

  (SchemaStorageStrategy) Determines how to automate the creation of
  columns based on the data that is being stored. If you want to have
  full control over the schema you may set this to `NULL` and create the
  columns manually.  
    
  The limitation with this behavior is that the columns created may only
  be of the following types:  
    
  - STRING  
  - LARGETEXT  
  - INTEGER  
  - DOUBLE  
  - BOOLEAN  
  - DATE  
    
  The determination is based on how this pandas function infers the data
  type:
  [infer_dtype](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.api.types.infer_dtype.html)  
    
  This may also only set the `name`, `column_type`, and `maximum_size`
  of the column when the column is created. If this is used to update
  the column the `maximum_size` will only be updated depending on the
  value of `column_expansion_strategy`. The other attributes of the
  column will be set to the default values on create, or remain the same
  if the column already exists.  
    
    
  The usage of this feature will never delete a column, shrink a column,
  or change the type of a column that already exists. If you need to
  change any of these attributes you must do so after getting the table
  via a
  [`synGet()`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/latest/reference/synGet.md)
  call, updating the columns as needed, then calling
  [`synStore()`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/latest/reference/synStore.md)
  on the table.

- column_expansion_strategy:

  (ColumnExpansionStrategy) Determines how to automate the expansion of
  columns based on the data that is being stored. The options given
  allow cells with a limit on the length of content (Such as strings) to
  be expanded to a larger size if the data being stored exceeds the
  limit. If you want to have full control over the schema you may set
  this to `NULL` and create the columns manually. String type columns
  are the only ones that support this feature.

- dry_run:

  (bool) Log the actions that would be taken, but do not actually
  perform the actions. This will not print out the data that would be
  stored or modified as a result of this action. It will print out the
  actions that would be taken, such as creating a new column, updating a
  column, or updating table metadata. This is useful for debugging and
  understanding what actions would be taken without actually performing
  them.

- additional_changes:

  (list\[Union\[TableSchemaChangeRequest, UploadToTableRequest,
  AppendableRowSetRequest\]\]) Additional changes to the table that
  should execute within the same transaction as appending or updating
  rows. This is used as a part of the
  [`synUpsertRows()`](https://r-docs.synapse.org/latest/reference/Table_UpsertRows.md)
  function call to allow for the updating of rows and the updating of
  the table schema in the same transaction. In most cases you will not
  need to use this argument.

- insert_size_bytes:

  (int) The maximum size of data that will be stored to Synapse within a
  single transaction. The API has a limit of 1GB, but the default is set
  to 900 MB to allow for some overhead in the request. The implication
  of this limit is that when you are storing a CSV that is larger than
  this limit the data will be chunked into smaller requests by reading
  the file once to determine what the row and byte boundries are and
  calculating the MD5 hash of that portion, then reading the file again
  to send the data to Synapse. This process is done to ensure that the
  data is not corrupted during the upload process, in addition Synapse
  requires the MD5 hash of the data to be sent in the request along with
  the number of bytes that are being sent. This argument is also used
  when storing a named list or a data frame. The data will be converted
  to a CSV format using the `to_csv()` pandas function. When storing
  data as a data frame the minimum that it will be chunked to is 100
  rows of data, regardless of if the data is larger than the limit.

- csv_table_descriptor:

  (Optional\[CsvTableDescriptor\]) When passing in a CSV file this will
  allow you to specify the format of the CSV file. This is only used
  when the `values` argument is a string holding the path to a CSV file.
  See
  [CsvTableDescriptor](https://python-docs.synapse.org/reference/experimental/sync/table/#csv-table-descriptor-reference-sync)
  for more information.

- date_columns:

  (Optional\[list\[character\]\]) (CSV file only) The names of columns
  in your CSV file that contain dates or datetimes stored as formatted
  strings (e.g. `"2024-01-15"` or `"01/15/2024 13:30"`). The columns are
  parsed with `pandas.to_datetime` and converted to epoch time in
  milliseconds before the data is uploaded, which is the format Synapse
  requires for `DATE` columns. The conversion is done by reading the CSV
  file into a pandas DataFrame and uploading a temporary copy with the
  converted values, which requires the CSV file to contain a header row.
  When `schema_storage_strategy` is set to `INFER_FROM_DATA` the parsed
  columns will be inferred as `DATE` columns. The parsed values are
  naive datetimes unless the strings carry a UTC offset — see *How
  datetime values are interpreted* above for how they are converted to
  epoch time. When the offsets in a column differ between rows (e.g. a
  mix of `-0800` and `-0700` values) the values are normalized to UTC,
  preserving the exact moments in time.

- date_format:

  (Optional\[character or named list\]) (CSV file only) How the strings
  in `date_columns` are formatted — a [strftime format
  string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes)
  (e.g. `"%m/%d/%Y"`) applied to every column, or a named list mapping
  column names to their formats. Supply this so that ambiguous dates
  (e.g. `"01/02/2024"`) are not silently misinterpreted and to optimize
  the data upload performance. If the values in a column do not match
  the format an error is raised.

- read_csv_kwargs:

  (Optional\[dict\[str, Any\]\]) Additional arguments to pass to the
  `pd.read_csv` function when reading in a CSV file. This is only used
  when the `values` argument is a string holding the path to a CSV file
  and either `schema_storage_strategy` is set to `INFER_FROM_DATA` or
  `date_columns` is provided. See
  \<https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html\>
  for complete list of supported arguments.

- to_csv_kwargs:

  (Optional\[dict\[str, Any\]\]) Additional arguments to pass to the
  `pd.DataFrame.to_csv` function when writing the data to a CSV file.
  This is only used when the `values` argument is a Pandas DataFrame.
  See
  \<https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html\>
  for complete list of supported arguments. Any kwargs you supply are
  merged on top of the default of using a backslash as the escape
  character, so you only need to override `escapechar` explicitly if you
  want different behavior.

- job_timeout:

  (int) The maximum amount of time to wait for a job to complete. This
  is used when inserting, and updating rows of data. Each individual
  request to Synapse will be sent as an independent job. If the timeout
  is reached a timeout error will be raised. The default is 600 seconds

- synapse_client:

  (Optional\[Synapse\]) If not passed in, the last created instance from
  the Synapse class constructor will be used.

## Example 1: Inserting rows into a table that already has columns
    # This example shows how you may insert rows into a table.

    # Suppose we have a table with the following columns:

    # | col1 | col2 | col3 |
    # |------|------| -----|

    # The following code will insert rows into the table:
    library(synapser)
    synLogin()

    # Also works with Dataset
    data_to_insert = data.frame(
        col1 = c("A", "B", "C"),
        col2 = c(1, 2, 3),
        col3 = c(1, 2, 3)
    )

    Table(id = "syn1234") |> synStoreRows(values = data_to_insert)

    # The resulting table will look like this:

    # | col1 | col2 | col3 |
    # |------|------| -----|
    # | A    | 1    | 1    |
    # | B    | 2    | 2    |
    # | C    | 3    | 3    |

## Example 2: Inserting rows into a table that does not have columns
    # This example shows how you may insert rows into a table that does not have
    # columns. The columns will be inferred from the data that is being stored.
    library(synapser)
    synLogin()

    # Also works with Dataset
    data_to_insert = data.frame(
        col1 = c("A", "B", "C"),
        col2 = c(1, 2, 3),
        col3 = c(1, 2, 3)
    )

    Table(id = "syn1234") |> synStoreRows(
        values = data_to_insert,
        schema_storage_strategy = "INFER_FROM_DATA"
    )

    # The resulting table will look like this:

    # | B    | 2    | 2    |
    # | C    | 3    | 3    |

## Example 3: Using the dry_run option with a SchemaStorageStrategy of INFER_FROM_DATA
    # This example shows how you may use the dry_run option with the
    # SchemaStorageStrategy set to INFER_FROM_DATA. This will show you the
    # actions that would be taken, but not actually perform the actions.

    )

    # The result of running this action will print to the console the actions that
    # would be taken, but not actually perform the actions.

## Example 4: Updating rows in a table
    # This example shows how you may query for data in a table, update the data,
    # and then store the updated rows back in Synapse.

    # Suppose we have a table that has the following data:

    # | B    | 2    | 2    |
    # | C    | 3    | 3    |

    # Behind the scenes the table also has ROW_ID and ROW_VERSION columns
    # which are used to identify the row that is being updated. These columns
    # are not shown in the table above, but are included in the data that is
    # returned when querying the table. If you add data that does not have these
    # columns the data will be treated as new rows to be inserted.
    library(synapser)
    synLogin()

    # Also works with Dataset
    query_results = synQuery(query = "select * from syn1234 where col1 in ('A', 'B')")

    # Update col2 of the row where col1 is A to 22
    query_results[query_results$col1 == "A", "col2"] = 22

    # Update col3 of the row where col1 is B to 33
    query_results[query_results$col1 == "B", "col3"] = 33

    Table(id = "syn1234") |> synStoreRows(values = query_results)

    # The resulting table will look like this:

    # | col1 | col2 | col3 |
    # |------|------| -----|
    # | A    | 22   | 1    |
    # | B    | 2    | 33   |
    # | C    | 3    | 3    |

## Example 5: Inserting rows from a CSV file that contains date columns
    # This example shows how you may insert rows from a CSV file that contains
    # date columns. The date columns are converted
    # to epoch time in milliseconds before the data is uploaded so that Synapse
    # can store them in DATE columns.

    # Suppose we have a CSV file with the following data:

    # | col1 | date_col1  | date_col2  |
    # |------|------------|------------|
    # | A    | 01/15/2024 | 2024-01-20 |
    # | B    | 02/20/2024 | 2024-02-25 |
